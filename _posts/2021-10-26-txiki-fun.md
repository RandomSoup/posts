title: txiki.js fun

[txiki.js](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js) is a small JavaScript runtime
built around [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/), [libuv](https://libuv.org/),
and [curl](https://curl.se/). Both QuickJS and txiki are relatively small,
fast, and have very hackable codebases.

## QuickJS and Duktape
I am a big fan of [Duktape](https://duktape.org/), another small embeddable
JS stack-based engine. Despite it being small, it's used by big projects
like [Netsurf](http://www.netsurf-browser.org/) as their engine. It has always
seemed like the obvious option for any JS embedding work for me, since I
was familiar with it and thought it was the fastest of these small engines.
Until I actually looked into QuickJS! In [comparision](https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html)
with Duktape, it's smaller, supports more features (Duktape supports ES5.1
plus some ES6/7 features and extensions, while QuickJS supports full-ish ES2020),
and runs faster (almost as fast as [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev), that is **27 MiB**).

API-wise, I can't really tell if I like Duktape's lower-level approach or
QuickJS's not-by-much-higher-level approach. Both support almost any platform
and can compile to WebAssembly, and are licensed under an MIT license.

_Anyways..._

## QuickJS
As you may have noticed, QuickJS is great, but here are some more "technical"
details:
 + It compiles JS to an internal bytecode format directly, and executes it.
   This means no immediate trees, faster performance, and lower memory usage.
 + It doesn't support CommonJS modules natively, but it does support ES6
   modules.
 + You can "compile" your JS modules into bytecode contained in a C array
   and then link against QuickJS to produce standalone (or shared) executables.
 + It has an official minimal runtime, `qjs`, which provides a `console`
   object and some basic path/URL/file manipulation functions.
 + TODO: Add more stuff here?

## txiki itself
txiki provides web-like APIs (`XMLHttpRequest`, [custom] events, workers,
the `console` object, and a `window` alias for `globalThis`), plus some
custom features like raw sockets, Unix-specific stuff, and misc modules
like `path` (exposed globally) and `fs` (as a proper module). Aditionally,
there's optional WASM and (basic?) [WASI](https://wasi.dev) support via
[wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) (note that it's an interpreter and
not a JIT compiler!).

## Loading JS/bytecode/JSON/native code
QuickJS allows you to set a custom ES6 module loader via the `JS_SetModuleLoaderFunc`
function, and that's what runtimes like `qjs` and txiki do. txiki's loader,
[`tjs_module_loader`](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js/blob/master/src/modules.c#L71),
is able to load JS files (duh) ~~and WASM modules when support is compiled
in~~ (that's actually wrong, WASM is loaded via the standard `WebAssembly` 
interface, thanks to TBR for pointing it out). In the past it was able to load
native modules, but support was [removed](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js/commit/f7bef82f380c5310ed58efacbc602272118089b1)
for [some reason](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js/issues/159#issuecomment-749551308).
I guess that after QuickJS's API slightly changed around that time, efforts
to migrate that part of the code failed. I tried to re-add this feature,
but I couldn't get a simple native module to work, so I'm not sure if it
worked or not.

Anyways, you have probably heard of cold-start latency before (if not, I
recommend reading [Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/making-javascript-run-fast-on-webassembly),
an interesting article touching various interesting topics). Interpreted/JIT'd
languages suffer from this problem, Java being the supreme and ultimate example
(try executing a "Hello World" Java program :P). JavaScript virtual machines
suffer from this too, and since QuickJS isn't optimized for performance
(e.g. it doesn't do JIT) it can't really compensate it. So I thought about
compiling JS into bytecode ahead-of-time with `qjsc`, and then modifying
`tjs_module_loader` to support loading precompiled bytecode. _Of course_
this isn't actually recommended and/or supported, since QuickJS's bytecode
representation can change between releases, and Fabrice Bellard himself said
that it shouldn't even be stored to disk, but it's fun anyways :P

So I made a [patch](../assets/00_bytecode.patch) for txiki and its modified `qjsc`.
The code is hacky and kind of cursed, and since I haven't had much contact
with the codebases before it probably doesn't fully follow their conventions.
The `qjsc` side was easy, the patch just makes it emit raw bytecode instead
of a C file containing an array. The txiki side was trickier, but then again
the codebase is really hackable and easy to understand: it basically uses
an internal function to get the pre-compiled module object instead of calling
`JS_Eval` in compilation-only mode.

<small>Oh also, the speed up seems to be minimal, but I haven't benchmarked it</small>

All the following sections are Works-In-Progress.

## The JS side
TODO: Document this.

## Speeding up with preloaded modules
TODO: Investigate why preloading modules seems to be way faster than loading
them on demand, and doesn't seem to slow down cold starts.

## Integrating yyjson
TODO: Maybe actually do this.

## Other stuff
TODO: Document it.
